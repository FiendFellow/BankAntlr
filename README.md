Welcome to CSC 521.  This course presents an in-depth study of the issues in the design, implementation, and application of programming languages. Topics will vary from basic to advanced in areas such as syntax, semantics, binding, data abstraction, exception handling, concurrency, and functional, logic, and objected-oriented programming.

Please refer to the [syllabus](SYLLABUS.md) for more information on the administrative guideline.

## Announcements

Important course news and announcements are posted here, so please check this `README.md` file regularly.

- 4/18/2017 Please watch the following videos for the next class:
  - Fletcher, Angus. [Emulators, Immutability, and Time Travel](https://youtu.be/fiK0SmaqN20)
  - Nasser, Ramsey. [Symbolic Assembly: Using Clojure to Meta-program Bytecode](https://youtu.be/eDad1pvwX34)

Please be aware that these two talks are **very** [clojure](clojure.org) centric.  So you might want to have a little bit of background on functional programming beforehand.  Regardless, for the next class I will talk more about functional programming.

- 4/3/2017 Please take a look at [Calc](Calc) example we did in class.

- 3/21/2017 
  - [Homework 2](Homework2.md) has been posted.  
  - **Regrade** If you would like your homework or exam regraded, please submit an formal request via email stating `problem #` and rationale why you should get a higher grade.


- 3/6/2017 Please note that I will not be in class today do travel conflict.  Please watch the following videos:

  - Guy Steele's [Growing a Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0). Additionally his paper [Growing a Language](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/steele.pdf) can serve as a reference.
